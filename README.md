# Markane

_Arcane focus for Markdown spell-casting_

## Description

Markane is a command-line tool for taking Markdown notes and navigating between them. The preferred Markdown dialect is Pandoc Markdown, although you can use it with CommonMark if you don't use some Pandoc-related features. Markane features include:

- Language server
  - Clients: [VS Code](https://github.com/garlicbreadcleric/vscode-markane)
  - Title-based file auto-completion
    - Triggered with `[` or when manually triggered inside the square brackets
  - Citation auto-completion
    - Triggered with `@`
    - Currently only CSL JSON is supported
  - Snippets auto-completion
    - Triggered with `/`
  - Title-based document search
  - Go to definition for links and Pandoc citations
    - For citations it opens file which has citation key as it's name
  - Document outline
  - Backlinks
- Creating files from templates
  - Handlebars is used for templates
  - Can use citation metadata inside the template if citation key is specified

## Installation

**Note**: Currently you'll need to clone the repository manually, but Markane will be available on NPM soon.

Requirements:

- Git
- Node.js (with npm or any other package manager)

**To do**: Specify the minimal Node.js version.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garlicbreadcleric/markane
cd markane
sudo npm i -g
```

### Configuration

While some basic Markane features (like preview on hover or go to definition) work out of the box, many other require a `markane.yaml` configuration file in the root of your note folder:

```yaml
# Specifies which editor will be opened for newly created notes.
editor: codium

# Specifies folders that contain Handlebars templates for creating new notes.
templates:
  - .templates

# Specifies folders that contain Markdown files with snippets.
snippets:
  - .snippets

# Specifies folders that contain notes. Currently the folders aren't recursive,
# i.e. ./notes/foo.md is included in the note collection but ./notes/bar/baz.md
# is not.
folders:
  - path: ./notes
    # A Handlebars template in the folder specified in templates field (see 
    # above). For example, in this case the template file is .templates/note.md
    template: note
    # A Handlebars template for the file name.
    file: '{{format "yyyyMMdd" now}}_{{slug title}}.md'

  - path: ./sources
    template: source
    # Citation metadata is available via the 'citationEntry' object.
    file: '{{citationEntry.citation-key}}.md'

citations:
  # Enable auto-complete for Pandoc-style citations
  autocomplete: true
  # CSL JSON bibliography file. Currently only one bibliography file per 
  # workspace is allowed.
  bibliography: ./references/bibliography.json
  # Folder that contain source notes. A source note has a citation key as it's
  # name and is a go-to-definition target for the corresponding Pandoc
  # citations.
  folders:
    - ./sources

lsp:
  # If true, the Markdown will be passed through Pandoc before showing in the
  # preview on hover. This is useful to properly preview Pandoc-specific
  # Markdown, i.e. citations, fenced divs etc.
  pandocPreview: true
```

## Issues and caveats

### Only inline links are currently supported

Support for reference links is planned. I don't really want to support wiki-links because I try to stick with what Pandoc supports out of the box, syntax-wise. It is possible I will reconsider if there are enough requests, though.

### Error handling

Currently in some cases Markane will just throw plain Node.js stacktraces without any explanation. Proper error handling and config validation are both high on the TODO list.

### Performance

Not necessarily an issue, but a thing to consider. I did some tests on larger note vaults on a MacBook Pro 2018, 16GB RAM, and it seems usable albeit starts to be a bit laggy on 10000 files with 140000 lines in total. I suspect this should be enough for most potential users (certainly is enough for me), so I won't prioritize improving performance at least until someone complains that it's actually an issue for them.

## Similar projects

- [mickael-menu's zk](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk) â€” A command-line tool that I've used for a few months before starting to work on Markane. I encourage you to try both, since they are quite similar but there are some things zk is doing that Markane isn't even trying to do and vice versa.
  - Some reasons to choose zk:
    - More powerful command-line interface (queries, fzf integration)
    - Wiki-links and hashtags support
  - Some reasons to choose Markane:
    - Better Markdown parsing
    - Pandoc citations support
