# Editor integration

## VS Code / VS Codium

[VS Code Markane extension](https://github.com/garlicbreadcleric/vscode-markane) can be installed from [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=garlicbreadcleric.markane) or from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/garlicbreadcleric/markane) if you use VS Codium.

Other extensions recommended to use with Markane:

- [Document Preview](https://github.com/garlicbreadcleric/vscode-document-preview) for previewing Pandoc Markdown with citations etc.
- [Pandoc Markdown Syntax](https://github.com/garlicbreadcleric/vscode-pandoc-markdown) for better Pandoc Markdown syntax highlighting.
- [Markdown All in One](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown) for checklists, some additional types of completion and more.

Personally, I've disabled all the built-in Markdown support in VS Code (`vscode.markdown` and `vscode.markdown-language-features`) as the above extensions replicate all the features from them that I need, but that is not necessary to use Markane. If you want to disable built-in extensions, you can find them by entering `@builtin: markdown` in the extensions search.
